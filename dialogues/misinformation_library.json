    {
      "id": "myth_01",
      "category": "acne",
      "claim": "Toothpaste is a great spot treatment for acne because it dries out pimples overnight.",
      "severity": "moderate",
      "why_false": "Toothpaste contains irritants like menthol, fluoride, and SLS that can cause burns, redness, and worsen inflammation. May lead to contact dermatitis.",
      "correct_info": "Use benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid spot treatments specifically formulated for acne."
    },
    {
      "id": "myth_02",
      "category": "sun_damage",
      "claim": "You don't need sunscreen on cloudy days because UV rays can't penetrate clouds.",
      "severity": "high",
      "why_false": "Up to 80% of UV rays penetrate clouds. UVA rays (aging/cancer-causing) pass through clouds year-round.",
      "correct_info": "Wear SPF 30+ daily regardless of weather. UV exposure occurs even indoors near windows."
    },
    {
      "id": "myth_03",
      "category": "eczema",
      "claim": "Eczema is caused by poor hygiene, so washing more frequently will cure it.",
      "severity": "moderate",
      "why_false": "Eczema is an immune-mediated condition related to skin barrier dysfunction, not cleanliness. Over-washing strips natural oils and worsens eczema.",
      "correct_info": "Gentle cleansing once daily, moisturize immediately after, avoid harsh soaps."
    },
    {
      "id": "myth_04",
      "category": "anti_aging",
      "claim": "Expensive skincare products work better than affordable ones because you get what you pay for.",
      "severity": "low",
      "why_false": "Active ingredient concentration and formulation matter, not price. Many drugstore products contain identical actives to luxury brands.",
      "correct_info": "Check ingredient lists for proven actives like retinoids, vitamin C, niacinamide at effective concentrations."
    },
    {
      "id": "myth_05",
      "category": "hyperpigmentation",
      "claim": "Lemon juice is a natural and safe way to lighten dark spots and hyperpigmentation.",
      "severity": "high",
      "why_false": "Lemon juice is highly acidic (pH 2) and phototoxic. Can cause chemical burns, post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, and increased sun sensitivity.",
      "correct_info": "Use dermatologist-recommended treatments: vitamin C, niacinamide, azelaic acid, or prescription hydroquinone."
    },
    {
      "id": "myth_06",
      "category": "rosacea",
      "claim": "Hot water and steam open pores and help cleanse skin more deeply, which is good for rosacea.",
      "severity": "moderate",
      "why_false": "Pores don't open/close. Hot water and steam are major rosacea triggers that cause flushing and worsen inflammation.",
      "correct_info": "Use lukewarm water for cleansing. Avoid heat triggers. Keep skincare routine gentle and minimal."
    },
    {
      "id": "myth_07",
      "category": "general",
      "claim": "Natural and organic products are always safer and better for your skin than synthetic ones.",
      "severity": "low",
      "why_false": "Natural doesn't equal safe. Poison ivy is natural. Many people are allergic to natural ingredients like essential oils, botanical extracts.",
      "correct_info": "Both natural and synthetic ingredients can be safe or irritating. Choose based on skin type and sensitivities, not marketing terms."
    },
    {
      "id": "myth_08",
      "category": "acne",
      "claim": "Scrubbing your face hard with exfoliants will get rid of acne faster by removing dead skin.",
      "severity": "moderate",
      "why_false": "Physical over-exfoliation damages skin barrier, increases inflammation, and triggers more oil production. Can worsen acne and cause scarring.",
      "correct_info": "Gentle chemical exfoliation (BHA/AHA) 2-3x weekly is more effective than harsh scrubbing."
    },
    {
      "id": "myth_09",
      "category": "psoriasis",
      "claim": "Psoriasis is just dry skin, so any heavy moisturizer will cure it.",
      "severity": "moderate",
      "why_false": "Psoriasis is an autoimmune condition causing rapid skin cell turnover. Moisturizers help symptoms but don't treat underlying cause.",
      "correct_info": "Requires medical treatment (topical steroids, vitamin D analogs, biologics). Moisturizers are supportive, not curative."
    },
    {
      "id": "myth_10",
      "category": "melasma",
      "claim": "Once you treat melasma and dark spots disappear, they won't come back.",
      "severity": "low",
      "why_false": "Melasma is chronic and hormonally driven. Sun exposure, hormones, and heat can trigger recurrence even after successful treatment.",
      "correct_info": "Requires ongoing maintenance with sunscreen, gentle skincare, and sometimes continued use of treatment ingredients."
    },
    {
      "id": "myth_11",
      "category": "sensitive_skin",
      "claim": "If a product stings or burns, it means it's working and penetrating deeply into your skin.",
      "severity": "moderate",
      "why_false": "Stinging/burning usually indicates irritation or damaged skin barrier, not efficacy. Can lead to sensitization and long-term damage.",
      "correct_info": "Effective products should not cause pain. Mild tingling from some actives is normal, but burning is a warning sign."
    },
    {
      "id": "myth_12",
      "category": "anti_aging",
      "claim": "You should save retinol for when you're older because using it too early will make it stop working later.",
      "severity": "low",
      "why_false": "Skin doesn't build tolerance that makes retinoids ineffective. Starting retinoids in 20s-30s prevents aging better than waiting.",
      "correct_info": "Retinoids are safe and beneficial starting in mid-20s. Consistent use provides cumulative benefits without tolerance issues."
    },
    {
      "id": "myth_13",
      "category": "general",
      "claim": "Drinking lots of water will hydrate your skin and cure dryness.",
      "severity": "low",
      "why_false": "Drinking water supports overall health but doesn't directly hydrate skin surface. Skin hydration requires topical products and intact barrier.",
      "correct_info": "Use humectants (hyaluronic acid, glycerin) and occlusives (ceramides, petrolatum) for skin hydration. Adequate water intake supports health but isn't a skincare solution."
    },
    {
      "id": "myth_14",
      "category": "acne",
      "claim": "Oily skin doesn't need moisturizer because it already produces enough oil.",
      "severity": "moderate",
      "why_false": "Oil and hydration are different. Dehydrated oily skin overproduces oil to compensate. Skipping moisturizer can worsen acne.",
      "correct_info": "Use lightweight, non-comedogenic moisturizers. Proper hydration can actually reduce excess oil production."
    },
    {
      "id": "myth_15",
      "category": "sun_damage",
      "claim": "You need to get some sun exposure without sunscreen to produce enough vitamin D.",
      "severity": "moderate",
      "why_false": "Vitamin D can be obtained through diet and supplements. Unprotected sun exposure increases skin cancer and aging risk significantly.",
      "correct_info": "Get vitamin D from fortified foods, supplements, or incidental sun exposure. Always wear sunscreen for intentional outdoor time."
